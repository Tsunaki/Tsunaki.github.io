	<h1>About</h1>
    <p>What can I say about myself? Hm... I'm currently a college student in Lisbon, Portugal. I'm using GitHub Pages as a mean to showcase some of my web technologies knowledge, while also letting others get to know me better.</p>
    <p>I'm patient, creative and a good listener, but I can also be fidgety and anxious, especially when I'm doubting myself.</p>
    <p>I love travelling, I've been to Macau, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Talin, Stockholm, Goettingen, Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, London, Amesterdam, New York and many other places.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I play video games and board games.</p>
    <p>Well, that's enought about me, what about you? Feel free to send me an email, or a DM on Twitter, even if it's just to say hi.</p>
